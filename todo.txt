Convert to a tile-based system
tiles will be structs, they will hold the following:
	bool collision, populated
	int backgroundTile, foregroundTile
	//these ints will be used as element identifiers for the
	//background and foreground tile bitmap arrays

class map
	string name
	string pathToTileset
	int height
	int width

class character
	string name
	int Xposition, yPosition
	bitmap array of the spritesheet




will require an overhaul of the gfx engine and make most of mapswitch.h 
irrelevant.
