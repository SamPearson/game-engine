Biggest todo:
Convert to a tile-based system

This will require a huge overhaul to the gfx 
engine simultaneously with the mapping system 
and the game will likely not compile for a while.
This will require thorough planning.

class map
	bitmap Tileset.bmp
	int height
	int width
	2d array of struct tiles
		bool interactable
		bool collision
		int background layer image
		int foreground layer image

class character
	int Xposition, yPosition
	bitmap array of the spritesheet
